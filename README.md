# KnowGen-RAG: A Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework

**KnowGen-RAG**, a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to process highly technical documents by integrating knowledge graphs—comprising entities and relationships—with Large Language Model (LLM)-based natural language generation. This innovative approach enables more effective comprehension and contextualization of complex information.

## Key Features of KnowGen-RAG

1. **Integration with Knowledge Graphs**  
   KnowGen-RAG incorporates knowledge graphs to represent entities and relationships, providing a structured foundation for retrieving and contextualizing information.

2. **Indexing and Enrichment of Documents**  
   The framework indexes PDF documents, enriches the content with detailed explanations, and organizes the data into a graph-like structure. This enhances the retrieval process and allows for precise extraction of context to address complex queries.

3. **Advanced LLM Integration**  
   KnowGen-RAG supports seamless integration with advanced LLMs, such as **Gemini** and **Cohere**, to further improve the quality and accuracy of generated answers.

## Benefits

- Improved understanding of highly technical documents.
- Enhanced ability to answer complex queries with contextually relevant information.
- Increased flexibility and scalability with support for multiple LLMs.
