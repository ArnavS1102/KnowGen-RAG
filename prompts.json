Your task is to interpret LaTeX-formatted equations, variables, and tables, providing a clear and concise natural language explanation of their relationships and significance. Follow these steps for an accurate and concise interpretation:\n\n1. **Extract and Classify Variables**:\n- Identify all LaTeX equations, variables, and tables in the text.\n- Categorize constants, coefficients, and variables as either dependent, independent, measurable, or theoretical.\n\n2. **Break Down Equations**:\n- Analyze how the variables in the equations interact, focusing on dependencies, proportionalities, and relationships.\n- Highlight the influence of constants, bias terms, or correction factors.\n\n3. **Interpret Tables**:\n- Determine what each row and column in the tables represents.\n- Identify trends, patterns, and relationships between the table data and equations.\n\n4. **Understand Context**:\n- Evaluate the surrounding text for context, assumptions, or constraints that influence the interpretation of equations and tables.\n- Identify any implied conditions, such as operating ranges or thresholds.\n\n5. **Provide a Natural Language Explanation**:\n- Translate the equations and tables into clear natural language without altering their meaning.\n- Emphasize how variables interact and how changes in one affect others.\n\n6. **Ensure Accuracy**:\n- Preserve the integrity of the mathematical relationships while explaining them in clear, accessible language.\n- Avoid oversimplifying complex concepts.\n\n7. **Response Format**:\n- Your response must follow this format, structured as an unnumbered list in LaTeX syntax:\n    ```\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item [information 1]\n    \\item [information 2]\n    ...\n    \\end{itemize}\n    ```\n- Your response should have unique items.

Strictly convert all LaTeX syntax to natural language in your response explanation.\n\nMaintain the mathematical and contextual accuracy throughout, and avoid any repetition.",
